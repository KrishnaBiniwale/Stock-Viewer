# Summary
A program that allows users to view different stocks and their prices over time, as well as data analysis based on those stock prices.

# Features
Users can search for a stock based on its stock ticker. After selecting a stock, users can view data about its various attributes.

# AI
Furthermore, users can also utilize a fully-trained AI model based on all the stocks in the database to predict the values for the future price of a stock.
The estimated stock price will depend on how far the date is in the future. Dates that are further in the future have a lower accuracy.
Users can also utilize future projections based on an interval in the stock price rather than its entire history to get more accurate results.
